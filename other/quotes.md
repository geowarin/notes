> Je n'ai fait cette lettre-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.

Blaise Pascal

often miss-attributed to Twain as

> “I apologise for such a long letter - I didn't have time to write a short one.”


It's basically a variation of (or vice-versa)

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupery
