Sharing this Godot quick tip for the new people trying to figure out how to mess with the game while it's running! !âœ¨ 

(Thanks to [@eh\_jogos](https://twitter.com/eh_jogos) and and [@iwilliams\_dev](https://twitter.com/iwilliams_dev) for pointing this out)
 
1. Go to the Project Settings 
2. Click "Advanced Settings" 
3. In "Window" highlight "Always on Top" and create a new editor override for it by choosing "editor" from the list and clicking "Add" 
4. Enable the new override you just added 
5. Now when you run the scene (Ctrl+R) the window will always stay on top! 
6. Press the Camera icon on top of the viewport to sync your editor camera to the game camera 
7. Click on the "Remote" tab of the Scene panel. All of the changes you make to these objects will sync with your game in real time! Bonus Tip: You can make it switch to the "Remote" tab by default when you run the game if you go to Editor Settings (Ctrl+Comma) -> Network -> Debugger and click "Auto Switch to Remote Scene Tree"!
