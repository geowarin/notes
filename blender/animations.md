> Cannot talk about modeling but just a little bit about animation. I studied animation but after the course I took a digital painting one for ch. design, so I’m hella rusty. To top it off, I can’t watch it frame-by-frame. **Take what I am about to write as like hints instead of rules, experiment with them.**
>
> Keep in mind the movements should be **arcs**, so they should follow a curved line instead of a straight one. **Example:** When she looks around, the head should go down too. To add details, eyelids should close too because the pupils inside move from one side to another. Why do they do that? Because _we unconsciously check the area before turning our head and we close our eyes when we move the pupils, otherwise we will get motion sickness._ The arcs movements should be applied to the pupils too! Keep in mind it doesn’t have to be a gigantic curve to make it work, **in animation a tiny change can make the difference.**
>
> Which brings us to the next point: **asymmetry.** Movements should be asymmetrical which you did for the arms, good job! This should apply to everything else too. **Example:** when blinking, one eyelid will move before the other one. 1 or 2 frame difference is enough. _It will not look like she is sick or whatever,_ you’ll notice the frame difference only on multiple watches and if you are looking for it. To everyone else it will look natural.

> To add more natural behavior, you should decide which part is **leading** the animation. **Example:** turning the head? Does she lead the movement with her forehead or her chin, her nose? So which part moves before and what after? Keep in mind _since the movements are delayed, their respective anticipation and adjustments should follow their delayed timing._ **Another example:** she wants to turn her arm to check the back of her right hand. Which part moves first? The elbow, the wrist, the shoulder or the fingers? If you want to limit the movement to just the wrist and the fingers: which one moves first and which one follows? **Last example:** when she blinks while turning her head. Like we said before, pupils move too so which one moves first? The pupils or the eyelids? And about the eyelids, which one moves first? It might sound overwhelming, but _you are just taking the timing of a movement and delaying or anticipating it of about a few frames._
>
> Last thing, if something moves **too blocky or snappy,** it’s the frames. _Keep in mind 1 frame can make a huge difference!_ Check for hold frames and ease-in/out first. Check the anticipation and follow through too. Don’t forget to play around with the breakdown pose, it doesn’t need to stay in the middle, it can be closer to one pose then then the other!

> **General advice** when animating: **have fun and experiment.** There are the 12 principles to follow but you can still play around and make it work ☺️ Hope this essay helps and it’s not too confusing, I forgot most of the technical words 😩
